# BraTS

As of now, this repository contains the code for applying zero mean and unit standard deviation normalization for the BraTS 2020 dataset.
The normalization is applied only to non-zero values in the MRI images.

# Note
1. The codes are made as user friendly as possible.
2. I have intentionally avoided OOPS concepts, functions and other programming concepts to make it easier for non-programming background audience.
3. Further codes will be added depending upon research progress.
